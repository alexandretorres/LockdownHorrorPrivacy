Lockdown Horror game: Privacy policy
Welcome to the Lockdown Horror app for Android!

This is a free Android app game developed by Alexandre Torres. This app is available on Google Play "as is" to your amusement.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data stored in save games is on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. The RPG Maker MZ game platform is stand-alone and serverless, meaning that no comunication is needed between app and any server, with the exception of css styles. As for the Google Play, I can only hope, as you too, that GOOGLE use your (our) personal data fairly. If you don't want to play using the Android platform, I suggest the web version of this game hosted at itch.io: https://alexandretorres.itch.io/lockdown-horror

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Alexandre Torres.
